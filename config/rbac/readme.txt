- role.yaml and role_binding.yaml are used for metal3 remediation
- role.yaml is generated by `make generate` based on annotations in metal3remediation_controller.go
- role_binding.yaml is hardcoded, and its ServiceAccount has to match the ServiceAccount used in machine-api-operator

NOTE: in case of updates, their copies (but with OCP annotations) needs to be updated as well!
